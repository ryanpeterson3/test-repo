Senators Alumni, Chris Phillips, presented France with a custom “Émile” jersey, along with Émile’s favourite jersey, beautifully displayed in a commemorative frame. The Lépine family also wore special Senators jerseys bearing “Émile” and “00”, a heartfelt nod to his birth year and enduring connection to the team. Émile, a devoted Sens fan, will always be part of our team. \n\nThank you to all who joined us in recognizing Émile Lépine’s memory alongside the Lépine family.",
